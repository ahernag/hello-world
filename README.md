# hello-world
going through the github tutorial
I am a "old" programmer that is trying to pick up new skills after spending many years as a bespoke programmer working at a software
company where I was tied to a certain Java or C API and stuck with some pretty limiting parameters of what I could provide for clients 
and how far I could extend the capabilities of the tools we had to work with. Much of this were internal time constraints which did not
allow for any discovery or expansion of skills except in the most narrow of viewpoints -- immediate payoff.

In a way I could understand this given that the management of the company was trending away from people devoid of any aptitude for 
software development or in the area of expertise for which my humble efforts were to serve.

Just re-reading the lines above has shows that I need to learn new skills and get to a different place with my professional development.

BTW I am here mainly because this is one of the places Zed Shaw ("The Programming MF") said to go to look at Python code while learning Python the Hard (Tedious) Way.
